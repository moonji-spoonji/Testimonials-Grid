## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I want to continue working on mobile-first design. I don't know if that approach worked well for this projects, so I will probably retry this in reverse.

### Useful resources
